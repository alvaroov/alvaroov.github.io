<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Global Cities <br><br> The importance of global cities for the leading economic sectors of today, mainly finance, is partially understood through the logics of finance which require agglomerated and concentrated&nbsp; centers to maximize operational effectiveness. It is additionally necessary to understand these logics alongside the historical analysis of Globalization and growth of neoliberalism. One must see the logics and processes of finance and high tech as being created out of trends of globalization, de-regulation, and neoliberalism while simultaneously and reciprocally occurring alongside the expansionist subsuming process of financialization and incorporation of national economies into global networks. As such it is important to note the development of global cities, important spaces for leading financial centers, as consisting of several feedback loops or reciprocally influencing processes alongside globalization and technology. This essay looks to make connections between the growth and power of intercity networks, the increasing neoliberalism and deregulation that these trends produce and require, and the highly specialized intermediary services which create the global city as a node for centralized management of global economic circuits. Lastly it will be important to consider the impact on urban life that these trends will produce.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the period after World War Two, dominant cities in North America and Europe were known as sites of manufacturing dominance and were homes to many of the leading industry headquarters. In what were widely publicized trends many of these manufacturing firms moved their headquarters from the city while banks, and financial headquarters remained. As communication technology developed, foreign investments and trade have flowed between countries, and the processes of globalization developed especially around the 1980&rsquo;s. Firms now operating on a geographically dispersed scale would now have to contend with increasing &ldquo;complexity and uncertainty involved in global operations&rdquo; (Sassen 34). Since then the growth of all of these trends, technology, international commerce, and globalization has only increased the level of complexity that is required to deal with various the forms of accounting, laws, cultures found at the growing scale at which these trends occur. This leaves firms with a gap or &ldquo;incomplete knowledge&rdquo; in global market economies (144). As such the global cities function as marketplaces and nodes for corporate services, built to fill in these gaps and allow firms to deal with and manage the added complexities of international markets.<br> The evidence shows that the &ldquo;network of global cities has expanded as more firms go global&rdquo; (113). These are interrelated networks but it is critical to note that there is not a single global economy sphere which subsumes everything. As such it is important to note that the various city sites or nodes specialize in particular capabilities rather than being capable of everything (217). There is clearly a reciprocal relation between the number of firms that go global, the number and volume of the global city networks, and the complexity required to deal with these expanded scales. These economic processes, however, would not occur and feedback without capital or money being the result of and fuel of such actions. The financial sector dealing disproportionately with the highest amount of transaction values thus becomes the specific focus of the development of power and wealth in global cities. It is therefore the case that there is a near equivalent relation between financial centers and global cities.<br><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, each country or geographically strategic area&nbsp; does not contain more than few if not one global city. Rather there is a trend towards &ldquo;consolidation in fewer major centers across and within countries, and a sharp growth in the number of centers that become part of the global network as countries deregulate their economies&rdquo; (220). This highlights how increasing international trade and globalization, could not have occurred without the deregulation of national economies and trade. More and more countries are pressured to drop the formerly dominant protectionist regulations which reproduced the dominance of manufacturing, mass production, and mass consumption in order to become incorporated into the international circuits. It is again primarily the financial sector, &ldquo;the opening of economies to foreign investors, and the explosion in financial innovations&rdquo; which has eroded the role of government in the international economy (34)(213).&nbsp; Even governments themselves are outsourcing government jobs to highly specialized, privately owned services significantly located in global cities in response to this added complexity and challenges of the current system (142). Thus the protections and regulations that existed for labor are removed, and there is a growth and need of an invisible workforce made up of primarily immigrant women in this context of high priced, high paced, high profits internationalized financial sector (128). This in turn makes it incredibly more difficult for other sectors including neighborhood shops, and low-income housing which formerly existed in the city space to remain there.<br><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In place of the formerly complex but incomplete, dynamic geography which makes up the urban, the infrastructure of running the highly specialized, global services for financial firms has come in with top of the line hotels and restaurants, airports and shiny new high rises. These are the sites of the specialized services which more efficiently deal with the questions of international trade. Financial centers as they exist today are sites which require &ldquo;massive concentrations of state-of-the-art resources&rdquo; and infrastructure to allow for greater control and central coordination by the globally operating firms (221). A significant factor which influences the concentration of these services is simply the &ldquo;increased capacity for social networking&rdquo; (221).&nbsp; In other words, a firm could operate all of its services underground, however, it would not have access to top talent, urban knowledge, and social capital, networks which, in the view of some, maximize the potential of the new advanced communication technology.<br><br />Ultimately, global cities made up of specialized services, and advanced infrastructures demanded by firms operating in an increasingly deregulated economies form the sites for maximally efficient and productive central coordination and control of the complex dealings of international trade and finance. As such the importance of the global city lies in the concentration of power, which &ldquo;is essential in the organization of the world economy&rdquo; (155). Which is to say that while it is recognized that there is not one world economy, the management of the circuits primarily composed of intra-firm trade requires centralized nodes of specialized capabilities. Additionally while management and power flows from above, the production and reproduction of the functions and inputs of global cities comes from below, from a willing and capable workforce and citizenry. For this reason the massive displacements, pricing out, and exacerbation of inequality, breeding urban insecurity and asymmetrical war can become another factor in the development of the global city. Along with state-of-the-art infrastructure and urban planning comes state-of-the-art surveillance and repression to quell massive discontent. As such in an analogy to the castles of medieval times, the enclaves of financial downtown centers, become a much more secure site for the leading transactions and trades in the leading financial sector.</p>

&nbsp;Gendered border violence.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Border&rsquo;s and border violence, are dynamics supported and perpetuated by the domination over life known as bio-power, as well as by the technologies of normalization, and governmentally implemented by the institutions of citizenship and the nation. There is a recent history highlighted by a change from the direct power of sovereigns or kings to a more permeating power which attempts to control the way of life, and modes of living. This history of liberalization in conjunction with the history of the nation-state, a history of racialized and gendered exclusion and normalization, includes the creation of an immigrant subject who is apart and continually excluded. In the United States immigration enforcement violence disproportionately targets Black and Latino trans and other individuals with gender identities which operate outside dominant binary gender categories. To attempt explain this asymmetry I will expand on how this power over life has created and excluded the subject of the immigrant and how it is related to the accumulation of capital in America.&nbsp; Lastly, I will argue that medical institutions and their practices which determine the placement of trans individuals in detention centers, along with the self-discipline and self-policing in the hyper masculine institution of law enforcement, expose trans individuals to violence and therefore inform the fact of trans people of color being routinely and disproportionately targeted. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For Foucalt, the domination over life, bio-power, is both &ldquo;relative and limited.&rdquo; It is relative in the sense that it exists only relationally both to a norm and that which is considered outside the norm. It is limited in the way that it is more subtle than the direct &ldquo;right to take life or let live&rdquo; of the kings of past ages (Foucault, Right of, 259). Yet, it remains dissymmetrical, however, now operating &ldquo;through state and non-state institutions and discources that are legitimated neither by direct elections nor through established authority&rdquo; (Butler qtd. in Hiemstra 77). The way power and violence is distributed and exacted, according to Foucault, is &ldquo;increasingly informed by the naked question of survival. (260). This is to say that wars and policies, actions by state and non-state apparatuses which we traditionally conceive as being the bearers of power, are determined and justified by this question of survival. A survival which depends on the complete control over lives, subjectivities, and modes of living. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Power, as such, is &ldquo;situated and exercised at the level of life, the species, the race, and the large-scale phenomena of population&rdquo;(260).&nbsp; Domination permeates throughout every aspect of individual lives; A simplistic way to understand this is to say that modern bio-power, borne out of the ideology of supposedly affirming enlightened ideals of what humanity should be, is the constant upholding of these ideals throughout everyday life. As such, citizens, their value and rights are determined by their relation to the future and fortune of society. Foucault explains the motives behind this ideology when he sarcastically asks, &ldquo;at a time when labor capacity was being systematically exploited, how could this capacity be allowed to dissipate itself in pleasurable pursuits?&rdquo; (Foucault, Victorians, 294). This question points to the upholding of stringent ideals, norms, and expectations by both structure and superstructure alike in a reciprocal manner. Foucault then importantly notes that, &ldquo;this bio-power, was without question, an indispensable element in the development of capitalism&rdquo;(263). <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lisa Lowe therefore explores how the categories of citizenship and immigrant, in conjunction with capitalism and the system of private property, operate by dominating immigrants&rsquo; lives through exclusion and marginalization. She importantly begins by noting that &ldquo;the legal and political forms of the nation have required a national culture in the integration of differentiated people and social spaces that make up &lsquo;America,&rsquo;&rdquo;(Lowe 2). This national culture supposedly abstracted away from any &ldquo;historically sedimented particularities of race, national origin locality, and embodiment,&rdquo; espouses hard work, &ldquo;triumph over weakness,[. . .] prosperity, and progress&rdquo;(2). These qualities which inform the abstract ideal of the good, true, American citizen, are also embodied by the ideal of a good worker. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lowe continues by looking at how this category has historically been inaccessible to certain immigrants. As she notes &ldquo;anxieties have figured Asian countries as exotic, barbaric, and alien, and Asian laborers immigrating to the United States from the nineteenth century onward as a &lsquo;yellow peril&rsquo;&rdquo;(5). These orientalist, colonialist notions of Asian immigrants, persisted as capital required a denigrated, and therefore exploitable and divided workforce to maintain profits. As such to fulfill the needs of capital, the definition and category of citizenship, normalize what and who a citizen is extending beyond the qualifications of embodying abstract values and culture or even being located within the nation. Citizenship thus as a category operates through racialized, gendered designations and valuations of proper immigrants and non-immigrants alike. As such &ldquo;the discourses accompanying [immigration] policies have racialized Mexicans in particular ways&rdquo;(Heimstra 79).Therefore it is important to note that while the exploited working class of undocumented laborers in the US, are constantly criminalized, marginalized, and reified as a threat to the US, they, nevertheless, still form a huge part of human labor capital and the US economy. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Given the relationship between immigrants and capitalism, the hegemonic &ldquo;evaluation of the relationship between resources and inhabitants, the constructing of tables analyzing wealth and its circulation&rdquo; (Foucault 262) as a discipline requires that immigrants bodies and lives be tightly controlled and their populations and flows be closely managed. As such the institution of borders, and citizenship requires more than the repressive defense at a geographical site to maintain the bio-power and domination over immigrants. It requires&nbsp; governmentality or rather &ldquo;techniques of governing, [including] the range of more specific regulations, knowledges, and representations that control populations&rdquo; (Hiemstra 76). This includes the technologies of the panopticon, such as auto-policing, self-discipline, and self-regulation to be able to maintain this control.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Nancy Hiemstra explores the mechanisms of governmentality and immigration concatenating to the category of immigrant, with the orientalist, colonialist discourses which it produces, the quality of illegality. She describes how &ldquo;while illegality, then, is rooted in legal classifications, its strength lies not just in law but, but also the discourses, politics, and practices which accompany the interpretation and implementation of the law&rdquo;(78).&nbsp; This interpretation of illegality which has both ideological and violent effects, produces in these effects certain modes of living among certain racialized people whereby the immigrant self-regulates and attempts to limit their visibility, or rather &ldquo;lay low.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; She argues that this designation of illegality serves for the benefit of neo-liberal, capitalist development. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As such the protection of the nation&rsquo;s border is dominantly portrayed and understood as a matter of survival. Discourses, arising out of notions of the normalized citizenry, interpolate certain immigrants and&nbsp; place individuals &ldquo;whether or not their presence is officially authorized or not, under suspicion&rdquo;(Hiemstra 79). Outsiders, foreigners, represent a threat to America&rsquo;s way of life as such the citizenry becomes as much a force in enforcing the borders than any institutionalized repressive body. Repression and enforcement of violence along the border as such is as such justified less by invoking &ldquo;the enormity of the crime itself than the monstrosity of the criminal, his incorrigibility [. . .]&rdquo; (Foucault 260-1). The image of the &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; immigrant, which is always held as a possibility independent of any reality, implicates all immigrants alike as irreconcilable threats to society.&nbsp; In the national sphere the tropes regarding who and what outsiders are must be continually repeated, until the norm is created and understood by all, which is that &ldquo;if you look like them you are not a part of us.&rdquo;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Moving on now I argue that given gender categories outside of those in the dominant binary&nbsp; which are illegible in hegemonic discourses and ideologies it follows that the task of governing, and dominating the life of the trans immigrant, requires all the more regulation. As Dean Spade, an activist lawyer, notes regarding the diagnoses for gender identity disorder, &ldquo;the invention of a category of deviation, the description of the &lsquo;ill&rsquo; behavior that need be resisted or cured, creates not a prohibitive silence about such behavior but an opportunity for increased surveillance and speculation&rdquo;(25).This subsequently is provided by medical institutions. Dean Spade, an activist lawyer, discusses the reason behind this which is that &ldquo;everywhere that trans people appear in the law, a heavy reliance on medical evidence to establish gender identity is noticable&rdquo; (Spade 16). As such it is through the medical evidence that detainees are processed and sent to respective detention facilities or parts of a detention center. Given this designation which does not accurately represent the person along with the already dire conditions in detention centers they may be &ldquo;unable to access medical care associated with their gender identity&rdquo;(16). As such trans people of color in detention centers are routinely exposed to the violence that lack of access to healthcare and anti-trans harassment brings. Similarly, many trans undocumented immigrants come to the US seeking political asylum meaning that deportation for them may be highly dangerous. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Queer detainees face rates of sexual assault that are 15 times higher than non queer detainees(QDEP). The additional policing and surveillance is not only from the medical institution but also from immigration enforcement. This violence that trans or queer individuals may face works by attempting to keep &ldquo;both non-transsexuals and transexuals in adherence to their roles&rdquo;(Spade 26). As such it is important to question the hyper-masculine institutions of policing, a quality potentially developed as a response to the docility imposed on the regimented individuals by the training and practice in police institutions. The anxiety that individuals in law enforcement face to perform hyper-masculinity requires as such that the victim of this performance be made effeminate through violence or degradation. This anxiety may likewise come about as an act of self-discipline whereby the police, detention center guard, etc. may feel compelled to maintain this performance for the sake of his reputation amongst his/her peers and superiors. As such we may note that trans women of color are more likely to be targetted by NYPD than non-queer immigrants (QDEP).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As such, given the many dimensions that involve the category of immigrant, whether it be&nbsp; the racialized notions of culture, people, or simply legal status, queer and trans immigrants of color have an added dimension regarding their gender which concatenates on them a greater need for the system to surveil and police their bodies. This system therefore exposes such people to higher rates of violence than other non-queer people. This is partially explained this by the way these added intersectional identities are reified.
